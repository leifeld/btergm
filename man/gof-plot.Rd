\arguments{
\item{x}{An object created by one of the \code{gof} methods.}

\item{...}{Arbitrary further arguments.}

\item{mfrow}{Should the GOF plots come out separately (\code{mfrow = FALSE}),
or should all statistics be aligned in a single diagram
(\code{mfrow = TRUE})? Returning the plots separately can be helpful if the
output is redirected to a multipage PDF or TIFF file.}

\item{relative}{Print relative frequencies (as opposed to absolute
frequencies) of a statistic on the y axis?}

\item{transform}{A function which transforms the y values used for the
boxplots. For example, if some of the values become very large and make the
output illegible, \code{transform = function(x) x^0.1} or a similar
transformation of the values can be used. Note that logarithmic
transformations often produce infinite values because \code{log(0) = -Inf},
so one should rather use something like
\code{transform = function(x) log1p} to avoid infinite values.}

\item{xlim}{Horizontal limit of the boxplots. Only the maximum value must be
provided, e.g., \code{xlim = 8}.}

\item{main}{Main title of a GOF plot.}

\item{xlab}{Label of the x-axis of a GOF plot.}

\item{ylab}{Label of the y-axis of a GOF plot.}

\item{border}{Color of the borders of the boxplots.}

\item{boxplot.lwd}{Line width of boxplot.}

\item{outline}{Print outliers in the boxplots?}

\item{median}{Plot the median curve for the observed network?}

\item{median.col}{Color of the median of the observed network statistic.}

\item{median.lty}{Line type of median line. For example "dashed" or "solid".}

\item{median.lwd}{Line width of median line.}

\item{mean}{Plot the mean curve for the observed network?}

\item{mean.col}{Color of the mean of the observed network statistic.}

\item{mean.lty}{Line type of mean line. For example "dashed" or "solid".}

\item{mean.lwd}{Line width of mean line.}

\item{add}{Add the ROC and/or PR curve to an existing plot?}

\item{avg}{Averaging pattern for the ROC and PR curve(s) if multiple target
time steps were used. Allowed values are \code{"none"} (plot all curves
separately), \code{"horizontal"} (horizontal averaging), \code{"vertical"}
(vertical averaging), and \code{"threshold"} (threshold (= cutoff)
averaging). Note that while threshold averaging is always feasible,
vertical and horizontal averaging are not well-defined if the graph cannot
be represented as a function x->y and y->x, respectively. More information
can be obtained from the help pages of the \pkg{ROCR} package, the
functions of which are employed here.}

\item{spread.estimate}{When multiple target time steps are used and curve
averaging is enabled, the variation around the average curve can be
visualized as standard error bars (\code{"stderror"}), standard deviation
bars (\code{"stddev"}), or by using box plots (\code{"boxplot"}). Note that
the function plotCI, which is used internally by the \pkg{ROCR} package to
draw error bars, might raise a warning if the spread of the curves at
certain positions is 0. More details can be found in the documentation of
the \pkg{ROCR} package, the functions of which are employed here.}

\item{lwd}{Line width.}

\item{rgraph}{Should an ROC or PR curve also be drawn for a random graph?
This serves as a baseline against which to compare the actual ROC or PR
curve.}

\item{col}{Color of the ROC or PR curve.}

\item{random.col}{Color of the ROC or PR curve of the random graph
prediction.}

\item{pr.poly}{If a value of \code{0} is set, nothing special happens. If a
value of \code{1} is set, a straight line is fitted through the PR curve
and displayed. Values between \code{2} and \code{9} fit higher-order
polynomial curves through the PR curve and display the resulting curve.
This argument allows to check whether the imputation of the first precision
value in the PR curve yielded a reasonable result (in case the value had to
be imputed).}

\item{roc.avg}{Averaging pattern for the ROC curve(s) if multiple target time
steps were used. Allowed values are \code{"none"} (plot all curves
separately), \code{"horizontal"} (horizontal averaging), \code{"vertical"}
(vertical averaging), and \code{"threshold"} (threshold (= cutoff)
averaging). Note that while threshold averaging is always feasible,
vertical and horizontal averaging are not well-defined if the graph cannot
be represented as a function x->y and y->x, respectively. More information
can be obtained from the help pages of the \pkg{ROCR} package, the
functions of which are employed here.}

\item{roc.spread.estimate}{When multiple target time steps are used and curve
averaging is enabled, the variation around the average curve can be
visualized as standard error bars (\code{"stderror"}), standard deviation
bars (\code{"stddev"}), or by using box plots (\code{"boxplot"}). Note that
the function plotCI, which is used internally by the \pkg{ROCR} package to
draw error bars, might raise a warning if the spread of the curves at
certain positions is 0. More details can be found in the documentation of
the \pkg{ROCR} package, the functions of which are employed here.}

\item{roc.lwd}{Line width.}

\item{roc.rgraph}{Should an ROC curve also be drawn for a random graph? This
serves as a baseline against which to compare the actual ROC curve.}

\item{roc.col}{Color of the ROC curve.}

\item{roc.random.col}{Color of the ROC curve of the random graph prediction.}

\item{pr.avg}{Averaging pattern for the PR curve(s) if multiple target time
steps were used. Allowed values are \code{"none"} (plot all curves
separately), \code{"horizontal"} (horizontal averaging), \code{"vertical"}
(vertical averaging), and \code{"threshold"} (threshold (= cutoff)
averaging). Note that while threshold averaging is always feasible,
vertical and horizontal averaging are not well-defined if the graph cannot
be represented as a function x->y and y->x, respectively. More information

\item{pr.col}{Color of the PR curve.}

\item{pr.random.col}{Color of the PR curve of the random graph prediction.}

\item{sim.hist}{Draw a histogram for the simulated networks?}

\item{sim.bar}{Draw a bar for the median of the statistic for the simulated
networks?}

\item{sim.density}{Draw a density curve fot the statistic for the simulated
networks?}

\item{obs.hist}{Draw a histogram for the observed networks?}

\item{sim.lwd}{Line width for the simulated networks.}

\item{obs.lwd}{Line width for the observed network(s).}

\item{sim.col}{Color for the simulated networks.}

\item{obs.col}{Color for the observed network(s).}
